### **[3] üõçÔ∏èCustomer Behavior Analysis:**

![Image Alt Text](https://www.customerthermometer.com/img/Ways-to-Increase-Customer-Loyalty1-1.jpg)

#### **‚û°Ô∏èImpact of Discounting on Sales and Profitability**

![image](https://github.com/tarundirector/tarunmishra.github.io/assets/85684655/0ff5278a-0f1d-4900-8ecf-be1bd408314a)

- **Sales Impact**: As expected, higher discounts tend to result in increased sales. We observed a positive correlation between the discount rate and sales revenue. However, it's essential to note that while higher discounts may drive higher sales volumes, they may not always translate to increased profitability.
  
- **Profitability Impact**: Interestingly, our analysis uncovered a nonlinear relationship between discount rates and profitability. While moderate discounts (10% to 20%) were associated with positive profit margins, offering deeper discounts beyond 20% led to diminishing returns and, in some cases, negative profitability. This suggests that while discounts can stimulate sales, they can also erode profit margins if not managed effectively.

#### **‚û°Ô∏èCorrelation Between Customer Segments and Product Categories**

![image](https://github.com/tarundirector/tarunmishra.github.io/assets/85684655/6832d295-9efe-4204-8522-037a3c83a5a2)


- **Furniture**: Consumer segments showed the highest sales performance in the furniture category, followed closely by the Corporate segment. This suggests that furniture products may have higher appeal or demand among individual consumers and corporate buyers.
  
- **Office Supplies**: The Corporate segment exhibited comparable sales performance in the office supplies category, indicating a strong demand for office-related products among corporate buyers. However, there was relatively lower performance in the home office segment.
  
- **Technology**: The technology category demonstrated consistent sales performance across all customer segments, with no significant variations observed. This indicates a universal appeal for technology products among consumers, corporate clients, and home office users.

#### üöÄüîÑ Insights and Recommendations

- **Optimize Discount Strategies**: Tailor discounts to specific customer segments and product categories to maximize sales without compromising profitability. Consider dynamic pricing algorithms for optimal discount levels.

- **Focus on Top Categories**: Prioritize product categories with high sales potential among specific customer segments. Invest in marketing efforts to boost sales for top-performing categories.

- **Refine Customer Segmentation**: Continuously refine segmentation strategies to meet the unique needs of different customer segments. Leverage machine learning for identifying hidden patterns and micro-segments.

### **[4] üì¶Shipping Analysis:**

![Image Alt Text](https://wl-img-prd.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/c1d51abd-29d9-488e-8dd9-a27a6658b17b-h.png)


#### **‚û°Ô∏èShipping Preferences:**

![image](https://github.com/tarundirector/tarunmishra.github.io/assets/85684655/56aa862f-b023-4936-bd3a-4ac23ff4a4c2)

The data revealed that the majority of customers, irrespective of their segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office), prefer Standard Class shipping, followed by Second Class and then First Class. Same Day shipping is the least preferred option among customers.

#### **‚û°Ô∏èShipping Time Analysis:**

![image](https://github.com/tarundirector/tarunmishra.github.io/assets/85684655/64f8e650-a1e0-4ce4-b4d1-b239a7cb3b3e)


- First Class: Approximately 2.18 days on average.
- Same Day: Very low shipping time, averaging at 0.04 days.
- Second Class: About 3.24 days on average.
- Standard Class: The longest shipping time, averaging at 5.01 days.

These findings suggest that customers prioritize quicker delivery options such as First Class and Same Day when available, although Standard Class remains the most commonly chosen option, possibly due to its lower cost.

**‚û°Ô∏èCorrelation Analysis for Average Order Value & Shipping Time:**

![image](https://github.com/tarundirector/tarunmishra.github.io/assets/85684655/2b6872ed-dc57-4b14-8229-f1a0e5f41f6e)


To explore the relationship between shipping times and sales, we analyzed the correlation between shipping time and sales value. The analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between faster shipping times and higher order values. Despite some fluctuations, the overall trend suggests that faster shipping times do not consistently lead to higher sales values.


**üöÄüîÑ Insights and Recommendations:**

- **Customer Preferences:** Customers prioritize cost-efficiency over speed, preferring Standard Class shipping. Offering flexible shipping options, including competitive rates for expedited shipping, can cater to those seeking quicker delivery.
- **Shipping Operations Optimization:** Analyzing shipping times can streamline operations and enhance efficiency. Investing in logistics infrastructure can reduce shipping times, boosting customer satisfaction.
- **Sales Strategy Enhancement:** Although faster shipping may not always increase sales values, it can improve customer experience and loyalty. Implementing transparent tracking and proactive communication can drive repeat purchases.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Continuous monitoring of shipping preferences and their impact on sales is crucial. Leveraging data analytics tools can provide deeper insights into customer behavior for agile decision-making.
