# ðŸŒ±Sustainable MCR dashboard

The Sustainable MCR dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for tracking and promoting environmental sustainability initiatives within the Students' Union (SU) at the University of Manchester. As a Student Data Analyst, my role in developing this dashboard was pivotal in harnessing data-driven insights to drive impactful sustainability actions throughout the university community.

The dashboard features an array of functionalities aimed at capturing student engagement in sustainable behaviors and practices. Through interactive surveys, students can conveniently select the sustainable behaviors they are currently engaging in, providing valuable data on the prevalence of eco-friendly actions among the student body. Additionally, the dashboard identifies barriers preventing students from adopting sustainable practices, shedding light on key challenges that need to be addressed to foster a more sustainable campus culture.

Importantly, the dashboard delves into students' sustainability concerns, allowing them to articulate their environmental priorities and aspirations. By understanding these concerns, the SU can tailor its sustainability initiatives to address the most pressing issues faced by the student community, thereby maximizing impact and relevance.

One of the standout features of the dashboard is its focus on SU impact on sustainability. By soliciting feedback on the most impactful SU actions and initiatives promoting sustainability, the dashboard provides valuable insights into which initiatives resonate most with students and drive meaningful change. This information enables the SU to allocate resources more effectively and prioritize initiatives that yield the greatest environmental benefits.

Moreover, the dashboard facilitates communication with non-technical stakeholders by offering intuitive filters for sorting survey responses based on various demographic variables such as student type, nationality, ethnicity, gender, and more. This allows SU members and university administrators to gain nuanced insights into sustainability trends across different student demographics, informing targeted interventions and communications strategies.

Overall, the Sustainable MCR dashboard represents a powerful tool for driving positive change and fostering a culture of environmental stewardship within the University of Manchester community. By leveraging data to inform decision-making and engage stakeholders, the SU can lead by example and inspire meaningful action towards a more sustainable future.
