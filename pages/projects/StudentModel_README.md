title: "The Student Model Dashboard üéì"
---

During my role as a Student Data Analyst at the University of Manchester Students' Union, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard named *The Student Model*. This dashboard was created with the goal of improving the student experience by analysing data gathered through two extensive surveys, **Build MCR** and **Educate MCR**. These surveys collected over 12,000 responses from the student body, providing valuable insights into various aspects of student life and university engagement.

The dashboard is structured to address four major topics that are crucial to students' academic and personal success at the university:

1. **Satisfaction with University Experience**
2. **Progression Efficacy**
3. **Career Readiness/Employability**
4. **NSS: SU Representation of Academic Interests**

These topics were broken down into first- and second-level predictors, allowing for in-depth analysis of factors that influence key student outcomes. The dashboard integrates complex data, making it accessible and actionable for decision-makers, while providing a user-friendly interface for navigating between these various areas.

#### 1. **Satisfaction with University Experience** üòä
This section evaluates the overall student experience and highlights predictors that influence satisfaction levels, such as:
- **Learning Experience**
- **Social Life**
- **Assessment Experience**
- **Career Support**
- **Accommodation Life**
- **Confidence in Skills Learned**

Each of these variables is considered part of the "Student Health/Hygiene Measures" and is mapped to predict satisfaction with the overall university experience. By clicking on each predictor button, users are directed to visualisations and plots that further break down how these variables affect student satisfaction. For example, the **Learning Experience** is predicted by factors like educational gains, university communication of goals, and academic support. These relationships are visualised in easy-to-understand charts, allowing stakeholders to identify areas where the student experience can be improved.

#### 2. **Progression Efficacy** üìà
The dashboard also assesses **Progression Efficacy**, focusing on whether students feel capable of advancing in their academic journey. The first-level predictors for this include:
- **Student Health**
- **Sense of Belonging**
- **Confidence in Ability to Succeed**
- **Citizen Mindset** (contributing to the community)

Further analysis of **Student Health** reveals second-level predictors such as **Food Insecurity** and **Academic Support**, highlighting the importance of these factors in determining whether students feel supported in their progression. This section is especially useful for identifying potential barriers to academic success, and can guide university policies around student welfare and support services.

#### 3. **Career Readiness and Employability** üíº
Career readiness is another critical area addressed in the dashboard. This section uses predictors such as:
- **Satisfaction with Skills Learned**
- **Deep Sense of Belonging**
- **Assessment Experience**

These variables provide insights into how well students feel prepared for their post-graduation careers. Detailed plots show how academic experiences, like assessments and university-provided career support, contribute to students' confidence in securing jobs or further education. By understanding these connections, university career services can better tailor their support to improve employability outcomes.

#### 4. **NSS: SU Representation of Academic Interests** üé§
The final major section deals with the **National Student Survey (NSS)** results, particularly in relation to how well the Students' Union (SU) represents students‚Äô academic interests. Predictors include:
- **Satisfaction with the SU**
- **Belonging to the SU**
- **Effectiveness of Feedback from SU Services**

The second-level predictors focus on the effectiveness of the SU‚Äôs leadership and communication. For example, factors such as **Awareness of Advocacy** and **Satisfaction with SU Services** play a significant role in students‚Äô sense of belonging and their perception of the SU's effectiveness. Each of these predictors is visualised in detailed plots, making it easy for university officials to understand where the SU is succeeding and where improvements might be needed.

#### **Dashboard Navigation and Features** üîç
The dashboard is designed with an intuitive user experience in mind. The main page serves as the starting point, from which users can select any of the four main topics. Each topic has its own dedicated page, where users can explore first- and second-level predictors by clicking on the respective buttons. This hierarchical approach allows for both broad overviews and more granular insights.

Key features of the dashboard include:
- **Filters**: Available on every page, filters allow users to narrow down the data based on demographic variables such as ethnic identity, gender identity, sexual orientation, culture, disability status, and more. This enables stakeholders to analyse how different student groups experience university life.
- **KPIs**: Each page includes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as total student count and specific metrics related to the selected topic, making it easier to track overall trends and group-specific insights.
- **Back and Home Buttons**: Navigation between different sections is simplified with dedicated buttons that allow users to return to the main page or previous sections without losing context.
- **Notes for Reference**: Each page is accompanied by notes and explanations, ensuring that even non-technical users can understand the data and its implications.

#### **Impact and Utility** üåç
The *Student Model* dashboard is more than just a data visualisation tool; it‚Äôs a strategic resource that helps university leaders, student services, and the Students‚Äô Union make data-driven decisions. By addressing key areas such as student satisfaction, career readiness, and progression efficacy, the dashboard provides actionable insights that can directly inform policy changes, resource allocation, and strategic initiatives aimed at improving student outcomes.

In summary, *The Student Model* dashboard serves as a comprehensive, interactive tool that translates complex survey data into clear, actionable insights. It helps the University of Manchester better understand student needs and tailor its services to foster an environment where students can thrive academically, socially, and professionally.
