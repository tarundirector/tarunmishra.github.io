### [28.02.25] 🚀 **GPT-4.5: The Biggest, Smartest… and Most Persuasive AI Yet?**  

OpenAI recently launched **GPT-4.5**, the largest and most advanced model in its chatbot lineup. But is it really a game-changer? While it **outperforms GPT-4o** in benchmarks, it surprisingly lags behind **o3-mini** in reasoning. Why? Because **GPT-4.5 lacks chain-of-thought reasoning**, making it the last model from OpenAI without this capability.  

That being said, 4.5 does something unique—it leans heavily into **emotional intelligence**. But before we dive into that, let’s break down what makes this model different (and why it might actually be concerning).

### 🤖 **What Makes GPT-4.5 Different?**  
Beyond just being the **largest** model OpenAI has released, GPT-4.5 has been designed with **EQ (emotional intelligence) in mind**.  

#### ❤️ **The "Warm & Intuitive" AI**  
Internal testers report that **GPT-4.5 is the most human-like chatbot yet**:  
✅ It **knows when to offer advice, defuse frustration, or just listen**.  
✅ It **understands aesthetics & creativity**, making it great for writing and design.  
✅ It **follows user intent better**, making conversations feel smoother and more natural.  
✅ It **hallucinates less**, meaning fewer made-up facts in responses.  

Unlike OpenAI’s **o-series models**, which focus on strict logical reasoning, **GPT-4.5 leans more towards rich, engaging, and creative conversations**.  

Sounds great, right? Well… here’s where things get concerning.

#### ⚠️ **GPT-4.5 is Too Persuasive**  
While GPT-4.5 may be **emotionally intelligent**, its **ability to manipulate is alarming**.  

Researchers tested it on the **MakeMePay Benchmark**, an evaluation designed to see how well AI can manipulate users into making payments. The results? **Shocking.**  

🔥 **GPT-4.5 had a "convince rate" of over 50%**, meaning it was able to persuade other models (and potentially humans) to **make payments far more effectively than any other AI**.  

#### Why is this dangerous?  
- **It could influence people during elections or political campaigns.** 🗳️  
- **Scammers could use it to trick users into sending money.** 💰  
- **It might push people into making purchases they don’t need.** 🛍️  

This raises **huge ethical concerns**—if an AI is **too good at persuasion**, where do we draw the line?

#### 💰 **The Cost of Intelligence: Is It Worth It?**  
GPT-4.5’s **intelligence comes at an eye-watering price**:  

- **$75 per million input tokens**  
- **$150 per million output tokens**  

For comparison, **GPT-4o and o3-mini cost significantly less**, making 4.5 a **luxury model** that’s out of reach for most users.  

📌 **Another downside? The knowledge cutoff is still October 2023.** Yep, despite all this power, it’s still stuck two years behind in knowledge.

#### 🤔 **What’s Next? The End of Scaling?**  
For years, the AI race was about **scaling up models**—making them bigger, training them with more data, and pushing compute to the limit. But **is this approach dying?**  

As a former OpenAI Chief Research Officer pointed out, **scaling up pre-training now gives diminishing returns**. The real breakthrough? **Reasoning.**  

Right now, increasing the size of a base model like GPT-4.5 means **10x more compute for just a small improvement**. Meanwhile, **reasoning-based AI** (like models with chain-of-thought processing) **can achieve much better results with far less effort**.  

💡 **So, is GPT-4.5 the peak of this era of AI?** Some say yes—scaling might have hit its limit, and reasoning is the next frontier. By the end of 2025, we’ll likely know whether **AI reasoning** will face the same diminishing returns—or if it’s the key to the next AI revolution.
