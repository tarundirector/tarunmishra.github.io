##### 3. **pizza_name_id** 🍽️: Identifier for each pizza name.

##### 4. **quantity** 📦: The number of pizzas ordered in a specific transaction.

##### 5. **order_date** 📅: Date when the order was placed.

##### 6. **order_time** ⌚: Time when the order was placed.

##### 7. **unit_price** 💰: Price per unit pizza.

##### 8. **total_price** 💵: Total price for the quantity ordered.

##### 9. **pizza_size** 📏: Size of the pizza.

##### 10. **pizza_category** 🍽️: Category of the pizza.

##### 11. **pizza_ingredients** 🥦: List of ingredients in the pizza.

##### 12. **pizza_name** 🏷️: Name of the pizza.

## **Designing a PowerBI Dashboard: My Approach 📊💡**

In crafting a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI, I followed a systematic approach to ensure accurate representation and insightful analysis. Here's an overview of the steps I took:

![App Screenshot](https://github.com/tarundirector/HR-Analytics-using-PowerBI/assets/85684655/448b794e-dea6-41ae-bcfa-72ec64c56b17)

### 1. Measures Addition:

My initial step involved the addition of key measures that serve as the foundation for insightful KPIs and charts. Some examples include:
- `COUNTD([Order Id])` for tracking Total Orders.
- `SUM([Quantity])` to quantify Total Pizzas Sold.
- `SUM([Total Price])` to calculate the Total Revenue.
- `([TotalPizzasSold]/[TotalOrders])` for Avg Pizzas Per Order.
- `([TotalRevenue]/[TotalOrders])` for Avg Order Value.

### 2. KPI Creation:

With measures in place, I crafted essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to gauge critical aspects of the business, such as Total Orders, Total Pizzas Sold, and Total Revenue. These KPIs provide a quick and comprehensive overview of the outlet's performance.

### 3. Chart Development:

Following KPIs, my focus shifted to the creation of diverse charts, aligning with the specified requirements. Stacked bar charts for hourly trends, line charts for weekly trends, pie charts depicting sales distribution, funnel charts for category-specific sales, and bar charts spotlighting top and bottom performers were meticulously designed to provide a visually engaging representation of the data.

### 4. Validation and Cross-Verification:

Ensuring the accuracy of the presented data was paramount. To achieve this, I cross-verified the dashboard values with SQL queries as given above.

By verifying dashboard outputs against SQL-calculated values, I instilled confidence in the reliability of the presented insights.




## 🚀 Conclusion

In conclusion, this Tableau-driven Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard not only meets the client's requirements but goes beyond, offering a comprehensive view of the business dynamics. From key performance indicators to visually compelling charts, each element is meticulously crafted to provide actionable insights for the outlet owner. The integration of SQL queries ensures data accuracy, validating the dashboard's reliability.
